  "description": "The debate on integration of migrants is often about jobs, housing and material supply. Is this sufficient, or are cultural and value factors also important? If so, which ones and how?",
  "extendedDescription": "All agree that Europe must make better use of the productive abilities of migrants and that big differences in material living conditions can complicate social cohesion. After Almedalen last summer, the quest for “Swedish values” as preconditions for integration was debated, however without much clarity about what values were important. Perhaps the debate as such was a sign of a shift from the idea of multiculturalism to a more public embrace of the thought that big differences in culture and values can also complicate social cohesion. Or expressed differently: does this represent a shift from integration to assimilation? If not, what is the lowest common denominator for integrating values in our society and how can it be furthered and guaranteed? And what can Sweden learn from Canada, a country often mentioned in matters of integration, when it comes to the balance between material and non-material aspects of integration and assimilation of migrants?",
