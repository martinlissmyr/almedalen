  "extendedDescription": "From the early astronomers to space exploration, we are now living in Space 4.0, the era where space technology is vital for a multitude of services and something that affects business, academia and global interaction. ESA has defined Space 4.0 as an era characterized by a new playing field, unfolding interaction between governments, private sector, society and politics. New technology, new actors and new initiatives are redrawing the global space-arena. Sweden is a space nation with a strong heritage within industry as well as academia.
