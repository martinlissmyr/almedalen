  "description": "Most world religions have experienced strong, conservative and patriarchal traditions, but also given space for women’s participation, emancipation and equality. ",
  "extendedDescription": " The Swedish Institute in Alexandria, SwedAlex, gives space for Muslim women to explore feminism and challenge patriarchal structures in their religion by visiting historic examples in combination with contemporary experiences through dialogue. \nThe efforts of Muslim feminists to reclaim Islam, the Quran and Sharia for equality is offering hope and change in many countries and contexts. This year SwedAlex is bringing some of these experts to Almedalen for a dialogue on the role of women in Islam, the prospects for change and obstacles to feminism in Islam.",
