  "description": "Cities engaging with and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals may see significant positive implications locally. Addressing the challenges in a collaborative way adds value to processes of e.g., urban cohesion and food security, as will be showcased through the \"Stadslandet\" project.",
  "extendedDescription": "The world's cities are expected to collect and report data on a number of indicators – on housing, public transport etc. – as part of the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's). Approached wisely, what seems like an additional burden may actually generate added value to cities' sustainability work. The Urban SDG, Goal 11, draws particular attention to the importance of cities and local governments in addressing sustainability challenges. The session will provide an overview of the SDG's and how cities around the world engage with and implement the goals, with a specific focus on Goal 11. The importance of a holistic and integrated approach is emphasised. The development project \"Stadslandet\" ('Urban Rural Gothenburg') will also be presented and illustrates how collaborative efforts including public authorities, civil society, academia, citizens, and the private sector contribute to issues like urban cohesion and food security in novel ways.",
