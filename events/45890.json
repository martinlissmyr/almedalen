  "extendedDescription": "Increasingly, the quality of food is as important as quantity, and better food must become a priority in many countries. We will be exploring the topic of new food, new sources of proteins, sustainable agriculture that will feed more people a nutritious and safe diet, and how this can help end poverty and boost shared prosperity in our lifetime. The event will start with a presentation and panel discussion where everyone is welcome to take part in! During the whole time there will be plenty of opportunities to meet and talk with startup companies working with foodtech.",
