  "description": "What kinds of partnerships are needed, and how could they be developed, in order to scale up and accelerate progress towards sustainable development in and through education? This seminar explores what partnerships appear promising and which are still to be developed.",
  "extendedDescription": "There is a global consensus on the importance to promote sustainability in the form of the global Sustainable Development Goals. However, challenges exist in efforts to create action and synergies to coordinate diverse actors operating in different contexts. Governments, agencies, and non-state actors are becoming increasingly aware of that work on global sustainability issues in education requires cooperation and partnerships. This seminar will focus on national and international experiences and challenges. The discussants will provide insights from different organizational backgrounds, including academia, international governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and formal education.\n",
