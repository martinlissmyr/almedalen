  "extendedDescription": "The European Union, together with the Member States, have identified nine geographical and two \nhorizontal corridors for increased growth and prosperity through a more efficient transport system in \nEurope. Along with the TEN-T core network, these corridors provide an infrastructure for sustainable \ntransport for Europe's future growth, completed in 2030. \nSweden and Finland are covered by the horizontal and two of the geographical corridors, the \nScandinavian-Mediterranian corridor reaching Oslo, Örebro, Stockholm and Helsinki-, and the North \nSea Baltic corridor that reaches Helsinki. Together with the Bothnian extension and the Iron ore line \nfrom the port of Lulea to the port of Narvik they make up the TEN-T core network in Sweden and Finland. \n",
