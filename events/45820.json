  "description": "UN's Ocean Conference in June focused on the global Sustainable Development Goal 14 – conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. Will we achieve the goal? What tools are available and how do they contribute to the life under the surface?",
  "extendedDescription": "Today, the UN estimates that almost 30% of the world's fish stocks are overfished. It has never been more urgent to utilize our marine resources sustainably. In June, the UN Ocean Conference was organized in New York, and the importance of partnerships to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goal 14 was emphasized. In this seminar, we will look closer at the Sustainable Development Goal for our oceans and what conclusions we can draw from the Ocean Conference. Representatives from academia, governmental agencies, certification programs and businesses discuss the role of the existing legal framework and legislation in relation to other initiatives such as ecolabels, the commitment of companies and the impact of consumers to reach goal 14.
