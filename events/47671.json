  "description": "Youth, often bringing innovation, energy and optimism to the table, represent an opportunity for global peace and reconciliation. Their inclusion is critical to building sustainable peace, as recently recognised by Security Council Resolution 2250. ",
  "extendedDescription": "Yet, many remain excluded from participation in their societies, political processes and peace and development efforts. Given these challenges, what is needed to ensure that young people are engaged as active partners and leaders?\n\nTo take stock of youth engagement, panellists will describe how they have contributed to peace and development initiatives in their communities and globally. In addition to underscoring why young people should be included, the discussion aims to identify what challenges they face and how to strengthen their engagement. Recognising the need for ongoing peace efforts before, during and after conflict—and in “peaceful” societies—examples from Colombia and Sweden will be highlighted. \n",
