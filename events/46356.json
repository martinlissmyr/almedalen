  "description": "How much health aid (ODA), including SRHR, do countries provide overall, and specifically Sweden? How has this changed over time and why? What trend can we see, and what does this mean for Sweden’s role in the health donor landscape going forward?\n",
  "extendedDescription": "Sweden is the world's largest per capita donor, as well as a strong advocate for women's health and sexual and reproductive health and rights, SRHR. However, SRHR is a financially threatened aid area globally, putting pressure on Sweden and like-minded countries to gather forces and form stronger commitments for global health. The think tank Global Utmaning invites two representatives from SEEK Development, Berlin to present Donor Tracker, a digital tool that shows aid data from 14 OECD countries. Donor Tracker provides a detailed economic review of the various countries' aid priorities, trends over time, and in-depth insight into the thematic areas of agriculture, nutrition, global health, and global health research. The seminar will look deeper into the current state and future of health aid, including SRHR, and what global trends mean for Sweden's role in the health donor landscape going forward. ",
