  "description": "Safe communities are a priority objective to law enforcement and authorities that strive to fight against crime rates, which tend to remain stable year after year. How do we create a successful crime prevention? It´s possible by working closely together, as displayed in project \"Navet\" in Sundsvall.",
  "extendedDescription": "Make arrests and bring offenders to the criminal justice has been seen as a primary objective to keep the society free from threats to safety. However, a new paradigm is entailing a strong impact on the management of local communities; prioritize sentinel-like activities and the development of crime prevention programs may decrease the number of arrests and avert the ensuing costs. The success of such policies however depends on how close the collaboration between local authorities, police, institutions and the public is. The project “Navet” was born from the joint effort of Mittuniversitetet, Sundsvalls kommun and the local police in finding solutions for an open drug market placed in the center of the town. It is our belief that the drug market will disappear if we are able to make treatment and rehabilitation more attractive for hardcore users, to prevent the emergence of new users through programs of drug prevention in schools, and to modify the environmental urban design.
