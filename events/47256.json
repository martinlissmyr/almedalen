  "description": "The world is becoming a more dangerous place. Extremism and the number of conflicts are on the rise. And the consequences are global, in the form of growing refugee flows. We discuss the most volatile wars to watch this year – with Syria and Iraq on top of the list.",
  "extendedDescription": "There is a dramatic rise in the number of armed conflicts worldwide and the casualties related to them. International Crisis Group closely follows the latest development, and publishes early-warnings that identify escalating conflicts.\n\nIn the beginning of 2017, International Crisis Group published a list of ten conflicts to watch this year. There are the humanitarian disasters in Syria and Iraq and the chaos in Turkey. And the less publicized crises in Yemen and Greater Sahel, including Mali. \n\nFBA, the Swedish government agency for peace, security and development, has projects in various conflict and post-conflict countries. Together with International Crisis Group we discuss the patchwork of proxy wars, regional conflicts, failing states and lack of economic growth that is being exploited by the Islamic State in the Middle East, but also by extremists in African countries such as Mali. Research on possible solutions to the conflicts of our time will also be discussed.\n",
