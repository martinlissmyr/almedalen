  "description": "Civic freedoms continue to shrink in many countries along with attacks on human rights defenders, often when working on corporate accountability issues. The seminar will discuss emerging good practices and the positive roles business can play in protecting civic freedoms and human rights defenders. ",
  "extendedDescription": "We live in a world where we are witnessing diminishing freedoms. 3.2 billion people live in countries where civic space is either repressed or closed. Over 400 cases of attack on defenders focusing on corporate accountability took place in 2015 and 2016. Business, civic society and other actors can work towards the same goal of protecting human rights and human rights defenders and work against the shrinking space. An increasing number of companies are coming to realize the value of using their leverage to keep the enabling environment open – not just for business, but for human rights defense. These companies understand that they can have a powerful voice in the protection of civic freedoms, especially where abuses are taking place linked to their industry and/or operations. The seminar will discuss recent examples of emerging good practices and drivers of such actions.",
