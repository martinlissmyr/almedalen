  "description": "It is time to re-imagine the future of cities beyond clichés of the big city. What if cities are complex relations between the built-up and the not built-up in an urbanisation-induced landscape system? What benefits are gained and what new knowledge is asked for?",
  "extendedDescription": "Urban futures need collaboration between academia and practice at levels previously unimagined. Researchers and practitioners must find methods for overcoming entrenched disciplinary and professional habits to tackle 21st century’s urban challenges. Landscape architecture is a field whose researchers and practitioners increasingly address today’s most pressing issues provoked by global urbanisation processes. Hosted at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, SLU, the research platform SLU Urban Futures and the Movium Think Tank invite to re-imagine the future of cities along discussions about relationships between the built-up and the not built-up as one complex urbanisation-induced landscape system, which in Sweden as much as in Europe and internationally embraces a variety of patterns of living together, far beyond the cliché of the big city – join in for sketching out alternative perspectives!",
