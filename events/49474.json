  "extendedDescription": "All developed societies are undergoing major transformations. Ageing population, digital disruptions, political segregation, climate and resource shocks highlight that we are living in volatile times and economic growth no longer equates to progress as it did in the industrial era. \n\nThe NextEra global conversation arrives to Sweden. \n\nNextEra has had similar meet-ups in San Francisco, London and Tokyo already, and these have resulted in living nodes in the network. The work results in an operational network and book to be published at the end of the year.\n",
