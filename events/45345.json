  "description": "Interactive workshop in an informal and creative atmosphere where all participants, including international guests, actively take part in discussions on how to enhance social dialogue as a tool to create equality and decent work on a global level. ",
  "extendedDescription": "How can we develop real-life applicable solutions that help societies, businesses and trade unions to deal effectively with one of the key sustainability challenges - achieving decent work and reducing inequality? How can we promote leadership for dialogue and cooperation? What kind of initiatives do we need \"on the ground\" to build trust? \n\nThe Global Deal is a global partnership, launched by Sweden together with the ILO and the OECD, with the aim of finding solutions to the current global challenges in the world of work - through social dialogue. Well-functioning social dialogue can greatly contribute to decent work, increased productivity and inclusive growth. The Global Deal initiative is a tool to achieve goal 8 (Decent Work and Inclusive Growth) and 10 (reduced inequality) of the Global Sustainability Agenda 2030. By taking part in the interactive workshop, you will contribute to the Global Deal vision!\n",
