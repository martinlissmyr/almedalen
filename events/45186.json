  "description": "How is Sweden supporting people affected by crisis in Syria and Iraq? How does Swedish aid ensure that women and girls' needs are met?",
  "extendedDescription": "The war in Syria has entered its seventh year and remains one of the most complex humanitarian crises in the world. It has taken more than 400,000 lives and left 12.3 million people displaced. In neighbouring Iraq the picture is also bleak. Existing instability, violence and displacement has been brutally exploited by Daesh. The refugee and displacement crisis in the Middle East requires a new approach that puts people displaced by conflict first and strengthens their resilience. Crises are lasting longer, meaning people are displaced for longer periods of time. This means refugees must have access to good quality education, decent livelihoods, cash relief – not just traditional aid – and the needs of women and girls must inform every decision. ",
