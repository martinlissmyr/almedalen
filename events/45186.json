  "extendedDescription": "The  number  of  people  displaced  globally  is  at  a  record  high.  More  than  65  million  have  been  forced  to flee their homes because of war and disasters. This represents a staggering average of 24 people being forced to flee every minute. For many it is impossible to return home – conflicts can last almost 40 years and people  can  be  displaced  for  at  least  a  decade. This  global  challenge  requires  new  ways  of  thinking and  working  from  all.  Most  refugees  now  live  in  towns  and  cities  alongside  host  communities and the way  aid  is  delivered  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  new  global  landscape.  Finding  answers  to  long  running crises will require forming innovative partnerships and including displaced populations in the solution.",
