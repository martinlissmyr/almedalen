  "description": "Trump dismissed the UN early in his campaign. Now he proposes large scale budget cuts effecting peacekeeping operations in particular. At the same time the US uses the Security Council to take strong stands and urge UN to act more powerful. Who will build future peace and based on which principles?",
  "extendedDescription": "The UN may be on the verge of major changes to how it manages crises due to a mix of political and financial reasons. The need for reforms is well known. The new Secretary-General puts conflict prevention high on the agenda, moreover large-scale peacekeeping operations are very costly. There are 16 UN peacekeeping operations and 9 of them are deployed in Africa. Could the AU take a more active role? Or should the EU take more responsibility for peace and stability in Africa? European Council on Foreign Relations provides an analysis and policy recommendations. Trump's unpredictability has created uncertainty in international politics. Partly concerning the US engagement in multilateral organizations, partly concerning respect for international law and the norms of liberal democracy. Human rights, rule of law and gender equality have been brought into negotiations, conflict management and peace building since the post-war era. What happens when our current world order is challenged?",
