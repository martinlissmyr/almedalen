  "description": "Russian authorities are waging an aggressive campaign against all forms of dissidents. Is it our moral obligation to support those defending human rights in Russia? Could such support also be crucial for Sweden’s long term security? ",
  "extendedDescription": "Organisations working with human rights-related issues have been branded as \"foreign agents\", exposed to hate propaganda in state-controlled media, and it has become difficult to get financial support from abroad. Citizen’s rights are violated by new laws – e.g. obliging people to report suspected crimes to the authorities and partly decriminalising domestic violence. The strong connection between security and human rights was established already in the 1975 Helsinki Agreement which inspired large groups of people to organise and monitor their governments in relation to human rights – an important contribution to the end of the Cold War.
