  "extendedDescription": "The German federal election will take place on September 24 and much is at stake - for Germany, Sweden, Europe and the whole World. Will Angela Merkel (CDU) remain as Chancellor or will she be succeeded by Martin Schulz (SPD)? Which coalitions are possible? And how will the result of the election affect the economy?\nProf. Stefan Kooths, Head of the forecasting center at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW), whose forecasts and reports have been used by the German government and other national and international decision makers for decades, will give us his views on what Germany and the EU need to do to maintain and improve their competitiveness in a world characterized by uncertainty and international crises. He will present an overview of the largest German parties' proposals in the field of economic policy and what we can expect after the election. The questions are then discussed by a competent German-Swedish panel with representatives from companies, authorities and media.",
