  "description": "How can our cities use social innovation to change the way our society address refugee integration? This panel will discuss challenges and opportunities of creating inclusive cities for all.",
  "extendedDescription": "Agenda 2030 highlights the positive contributions to sustainable development by refugees. Despite this, refugee representation is limited on the local level. Why is that? The focus of this seminar is on the role of cities as frontrunners for the democratic inclusion of refugees. Our panelists will present possible innovations to create democratic inclusion for refugees at the local level. The main question guiding this seminar is: What are possible innovations or best practices to create arenas where refugees can participate in the decisions concerning their lives? ",
