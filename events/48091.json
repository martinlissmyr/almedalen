  "extendedDescription": "With the United States decision to cut support for organisations that defend abortion, the so-called global gagrule, the conditions for work for women in the world changed – again. In Central America, where women, especially those from minority groups, are already severely affected by violence, discrimination, poverty and repressive abortion laws, Trump's actions become a hard blow. The Swedish government took the initiative to try to fill the economic gap that arose as a result of global gagrule, together with other countries. But how can a feminist government, together with the civil society, ensure the active political dialogue and efforts needed to open up the world and ensure human rights for women in Central America?\n",
