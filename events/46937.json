  "description": "The United Nations' new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, faces a daunting task in an ever more complex world. In a time when global challenges must be dealt with by a more effective international community, the multilateral system is instead increasingly under pressure. ",
  "extendedDescription": "The UN and its core values are questioned and ignored while nationalist and anti-solidarity agendas continue to gain ground. These trends have real consequences and affect the political climate at the UN, as well as its financing; the Trump administration has already threatened to half its contribution to the UN. \n\nIn light of this, how can support for the UN and global normative frameworks be strengthened? What reforms are required within the organisation to meet the changing geopolitical landscape? What has Secretary-General Antonio Guterres prioritised during his first six months in office, and what can we expect in the years to come?",
