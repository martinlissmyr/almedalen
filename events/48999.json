  "description": "Taking Sweden and Catalonia as a starting-point, this debate aims at exchanging views between North and South in order to learn from each other and strengthen our common goals to achieve a new sustainable paradigm in social, economic, and environmental terms.",
  "extendedDescription": "Catalonia in the South and Sweden in the North are examples of how European societies are facing the challenge to advance towards a carbon-free paradigm. Catalonia and Sweden have very different geographic and climate realities, but in both cases there is a strong social and institutional commitment with the SDGs established by the United Nations in September 2015. In the past years, Catalonia’s efforts to fight climate change have increased hand in hand with the social demands to deepen democracy and vote on self-determination, along with the public debate around how to build a new country. Catalonia is leading the way in Southern Europe with a new bill to fight climate change, sharing economy initiatives, and a unique pedagogical model. Sweden is leading the way with a very ambitious climate target and leading measures for renewable energy and clean transports. With this debate we aim at exchanging views in order to learn from each other and strengthen our common goals.",
