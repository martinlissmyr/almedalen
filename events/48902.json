  "description": "We see several examples of states and armed groups violating the law of war, and it affects mostly the civilian population. There is no matter more urgent than their protection. We make a review of present conflict trends, looking forward, and seek the solutions.",
  "extendedDescription": "Civilians lack protection during conflict and other situations of violence and there are millions of people living in desperate and terrifying places, and there is no matter more urgent than their protection. But civilians must not only be protected from attack and the impact of conflict but also be able to go about their daily lives. But we see too often kids that cannot attend school, the sick cannot reach hospitals and livelihoods are interrupted or cease entirely. When people live in fear and cannot safely continue their activities, they risk becoming marginalised, destitute and reliant on humanitarian aid. ",
