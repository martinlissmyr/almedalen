  "description": "Social Democracy is in crisis in Europe. The French election is one current example of a withering political space for social democratic parties. Party memberships are declining and in times of rising right-wing populism, social democracy has a hard time highlighting it's own progressive agenda. ",
  "extendedDescription": "Young people all over Europe tend to vote more progressive than older generations. Politics is not at all dead for Europe’s youth but something that engages beyond national borders. Often this tends to happen outside political parties though. \nIt is high time to talk about the impact progressive youth politics may have to move political discourse towards progressive policies and to channel political engagement and passion all over Europe, both within nations and at EU level. \nIs Europe’s Social Democracy dead in times of a political debate that focuses on the conflict between liberalism and right-wing populism? And what can and should youth organizations do to channel young people’s political passions? Is it Europe’s youth that will save social democracy and a progressive future for Europe?",
