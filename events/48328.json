  "description": "Countries of the Baltic Sea Region are mobilising for war. Is Sweden doing enough to secure regional peace? How can we best work for de-escalation, de-militarisation and mutual human security? ",
  "extendedDescription": "We invite a panel of civil society activists to discuss how to break the current trend towards military escalation, stereotyping, and confrontation. What role should the Government of Sweden and Swedish civil society be taking in the BSR? Does Gotland have a specific responsibility with its unique location? Can the Åland de-militarised zone model be extended? How does Sweden's status as NATO transit land impact on our common security? What can we as individuals do to promote peace?",
