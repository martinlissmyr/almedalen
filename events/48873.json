  "extendedDescription": "Resentment to change and fear of the unknown have met new immigrants throughout history. Since September 11 2001 and after some of the religiously motivated terrorist attacks in recent years, in particular the Muslim communities in Europe have felt a popular misconception in relation to their integration. Myths, as much as reality, might accompany policymakers and authorities dealing with some of the challenges of global migration. Can the perceived threat be transferred into a benefit for society with help of an improved dialogue? Can dialogue help us to distinguish between real threats and misperceptions?\nThe Swedish Institute Alexandria is a Dialogue Institute within the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs with the aim to facilitate an improved dialogue between Europe and the Middle East North Africa Region, MENA. The perceptions of Muslims in Sweden and Europe today, will be discussed with an expert panel from MENA and Europe.",
