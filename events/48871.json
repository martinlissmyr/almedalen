  "description": "When the Cyprus conflict started in 1963, the Christian and Muslim leaders stop talking to each other and became part of the seperation. The Swedish Initiative Religious Track brought them together in 2009, and today they are contributing to the Peace Process. Can other conflicts learn from this?",
  "extendedDescription": "When the Swedish initiative called the Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process (RTCYPP) under the Auspices of the Embassy of Sweden, started to work with the religious leaders in Cyprus in 2009, the Christian and Muslim leaders had not met since the Cyprus conflict in 1963. Cyprus has never been a religious conflict, but religion had become part of the division. After 8 years of dialogue, the religious leaders have formed an initiative that has enhanced freedom of religion on the island and has made a solid contribution of confidence building to the peace process. \nThe seminar will share the important progress made by RTCYPP and in dialogue with experts from other parts of the Middle East explore ideas on how religious leaders from different faith backgrounds working together can prevent violent conflicts, promote the respect of human rights and contribute to peace building.",
