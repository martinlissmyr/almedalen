  "description": "Trade today is facing a number of challenges. International agreements are questioned. How long will the winds of change blow and what will international trade look like when they subside? How will the Swedish, export dependent, economy handle the consequences that Brexit and a reshaped EU bring?",
  "extendedDescription": "The Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU are expected to be difficult as the parties need to agree both on the divorce and future relations. There is a tendency that trade relations in the world are moving away from a rule based system, away from “rule of law” and towards a system built on populism, opportunism and nationalism. \n\nAt the same time we’re in the midst of the European super election year 2017 where interests for and against further internationalization are facing each other. Within the EU, where Sweden has to relate to a new order without our British friends, there are conflicts between east and west, north and south. Which obstacles can we see going forward –and which possibilities?\n",
