  "description": "Swedish consumption based emissions of GHG are around double as high as the emissions inside Sweden. At the same time research show that environmentally aware individuals do not emit much less than others. Do we need sharper control measures and national targets for the consumption based emissions?",
  "extendedDescription": "Oxfam has shown that the richest 10 % of the world emits half of the worlds consumption based emissions of greenhouse gases. At the same the poorest half of the world only emit a tenth of total emissions, they are also the ones hardest hit by climate change. \n\nSweden's consumption based emissions are double as high as the territorial ones reported to the UN and they are not decreasing more than marginally. New research shows that it does not seem to help that swedes get more environmentally aware, political measures are needed. At the same time, there are no targets or goals set to decrease Sweden’s consumption based emissions. \n\nDavid Andersson presents his research showing that environmental awareness does not seem to affect emissions very much. This is followed by a discussion with Kevin Anderson on the need for political measures and environmental goals to decrease consumption based emissions. ",
